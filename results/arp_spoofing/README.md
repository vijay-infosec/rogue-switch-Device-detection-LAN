This folder contains screenshots showing the ARP table before and after the spoofing attack, along with Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) logs.

## Indicators of ARP Spoofing
- Gateway and host MAC entries overwritten by attacker MAC
- Unsolicited ARP replies forwarded through the rogue switch uplink
- DAI violation logs:
  - "%SW_DAI-4-DHCP_SNOOPING_DENY: Invalid ARPs on Gi1/0"

These logs confirm that forged ARP replies generated by the downstream attacker were detected and blocked.
